# Red Bank Eats

---

## Project Purpose:

This app provides a listing of Restaurants in Red Bank, New Jersey. The project was built for the Udacity Front End Nanodegree Program. The purpose of the project is to demonstrate understanding of the basic structure and operation of a React-based app.

The map is generated by the Google Maps API. The list of restaurants is generated by a call to the Foursquare API Search endpoint. A second API request is made when a location is clicked to get details about the restaurant, including address, phone, price point, user tip and an image. A link to the restaurant's Foursquare page is provided for more information.

## How to Load the App in Development Mode

The project uses Node.js and the Create-React-App starter. If you do not have Node >= 6.x installed, you can download it here: [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

Once Node is installed, navigate to the directory where you want to store the app

```
git clone https://github.com/sarah-maris/reactnd-project-myreads.git
npm install
```

Once all of the dependencies have been installed you can launch the app with

```
npm start
```

A new browser window should automatically open displaying the app. If it doesn't, navigate to [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) in your browser

**_NOTE:_** _The service workers for this app will only cache the site when it is in production mode._

## How to Load the App in Production Mode

You can run a hosted version of the app at **[https://damaging-knowledge.surge.sh/](https://damaging-knowledge.surge.sh/)**

To run the app in production mode locally run:

```
npm run build
```

Navigate to the `build` directory and run a localhost server. If you have Python 2.x installed you can run the Python Simple Server like this.

```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080
```

For Python 3.x, the command is:

```
-m http.server 8080
```

In either case navigate to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in your browser.

Or if you prefer you can use Node [serve](https://github.com/zeit/serve). If you do not have it installed you can install it with:

```
npm install -g serve
```

and then navigate into the build directory and run

```
serve -s
```

In this case the site will be hosted at [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)

You can confirm that the service worker is registered with this message in the console
